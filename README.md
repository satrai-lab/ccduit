# CCduit: Pioneering Seamless Data Flow Between Federations Of Smart IoT Communities

CCduit is an initial blueprint aiming to provide a seamless interface for managing and interacting with IoT federations. It's designed to facilitate registration, management, and engagement between IoT federations and communities within them. **Please note that this code is (for now) a basic outline and not a fully functional system.**

## Features (Prototype)

- **Community Management**: Preliminary functions for registering, updating, removing, and listing communities.
- **Federation Management**: Basic functionalities for registering, updating, removing, and listing federations.
- **Community Interaction**: Prototype functions for creating, validating, and monitoring interactions between communities.
- **Integration API**: Initial design to integrate communities and federations.
- **Data Model Management**: Basic functionalities for registering, updating, removing, and listing data models and functions for validating and converting them.

### Data Models

Our NGSI-LD data models are the cornerstone of CCduit, allowing for standardized and consistent representations of communities, federations, and their interactions. More about these models can be found in the [NGSI-LD Data Models README]().

## Getting Started (Development)

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory and explore the `CCduit.py` Python script. Remember, this is for now a basic outline and not something that runs as a full system.
3. Refer to the API documentation and the NGSI-LD Data Models README for a deeper understanding.
