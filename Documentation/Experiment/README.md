# CCduit-ICSA2024
Welcome to the anonymized repository for the CCduit implementation, as presented in our paper at ICSA 2024. This repository hosts the source code, data models, and supplementary materials for CCduit, an innovative software overlay architecture designed to enhance interoperability and collaborative data exchange across federated data spaces.

## Overview
CCduit is a novel software overlay architecture that addresses the complexities of data sharing, protocol mismatch, and data sovereignty enforcement in federated data spaces. It offers a modular, scalable, and policy-driven approach to facilitate efficient and sovereignty-preserving data exchanges across diverse IoT federations.

## Contents
[Source Code](): The implementation code of the CCduit software overlay.

[Data Models](): Standardized NGSI-LD data models allowing for standardized and consistent representations of communities, federations, and their interactions. More about these models can be found in the NGSI-LD Data Models README.

[Documentation](): Detailed documentation on the architecture, setup, usage and experiments of CCduit.

[API](): A swagger compatible file showcasing all the different API calls for the interaction and administration APIs

## Getting Started
